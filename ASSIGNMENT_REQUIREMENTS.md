# Assignment Requirements Fulfillment

This document outlines how Millo's Cuisine Explorer meets the requirements of the assignment.

## Part One: Local Implementation

### Application Purpose
Millo's Cuisine Explorer serves a meaningful purpose by allowing users to discover and explore recipes from various African and intercontinental cuisines. It provides genuine value by:
- Offering a searchable database of authentic recipes
- Allowing users to filter recipes by region and category
- Providing detailed recipe information including ingredients and instructions

### API Integration
The application effectively utilizes TheMealDB API (https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) to fetch and display recipe data. The API integration includes:
- Fetching recipes by region/cuisine
- Searching recipes by name
- Filtering recipes by category
- Retrieving detailed recipe information

### User Interaction
The application provides multiple ways for users to interact with the data:
- Searching for recipes by name
- Filtering recipes by region (West Africa, North Africa, etc.)
- Filtering recipes by category (Vegetarian, Seafood, etc.)
- Sorting recipes alphabetically (A-Z or Z-A)
- Viewing detailed recipe information

### Error Handling
The application implements comprehensive error handling:
- Displaying user-friendly error messages when API requests fail
- Showing loading states during API requests
- Implementing caching to handle API downtime
- Gracefully handling cases where no recipes are found

## Part Two: Deployment

### Web Server Deployment
The application is designed to be deployed on two standard web servers (Web01 and Web02):
- Detailed deployment instructions are provided in deployment.md
- The application uses relative paths to ensure compatibility across different servers
- A health check endpoint is implemented to verify server status

### Load Balancer Configuration
The load balancer (Lb01) is configured to distribute traffic between the two web servers:
- Detailed configuration instructions are provided in deployment.md
- The health check endpoint allows the load balancer to verify server availability
- A testing script is provided to verify load balancer functionality

## Additional Features

### Performance Optimization
- API response caching to reduce load times and API calls
- Efficient DOM manipulation for better performance
- Optimized CSS for faster rendering

### User Experience Enhancements
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Interactive UI elements with hover effects
- Loading indicators during API requests
- Sorting functionality for better data organization

## Documentation

- Comprehensive README.md with setup and usage instructions
- Detailed deployment.md with server configuration steps
- API reference with endpoint documentation
- Code comments explaining key functionality

## Security Considerations

- No API keys required (TheMealDB public API)
- HTTPS configuration instructions in deployment guide
- Proper error handling to prevent information leakage
- Input validation for search queries
